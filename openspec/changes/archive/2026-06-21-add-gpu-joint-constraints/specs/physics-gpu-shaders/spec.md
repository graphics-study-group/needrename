## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: XPBDGpuSolver loads precompiled SPIR-V

`engine/Physics/XPBDGpuSolver.cpp` SHALL load all XPBD compute shaders by reading precompiled `.spv` files from disk and SHALL NOT invoke `ShaderCompiler::CompileGLSLtoSPV` for these shaders. The loaded `std::vector<uint32_t>` SHALL be passed to `ComputeStage::Instantiate` unchanged.

Loading SHALL occur lazily on first call to `Step()` (preserving the existing `EnsureInitialized()` behaviour). On loading failure (file missing, empty, or size not a multiple of 4 bytes), the loader SHALL throw `std::runtime_error` whose message includes the absolute path attempted.

The solver now loads the following shaders:
- `solver/XPBDSolver/integrate_forces.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/update_shape_world_pose.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/accumulate_contact_position.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/apply_body_position_deltas.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/update_velocities_from_pose.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/accumulate_contact_velocity.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/apply_body_velocity_deltas.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/snapshot_position.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/clear_int_buffer.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/model_matrix.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/accumulate_hinge_position.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/accumulate_fixed_position.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/clear_hinge_lagrange.comp.spv`
- `solver/XPBDSolver/clear_fixed_lagrange.comp.spv`

The `step.comp` placeholder SHALL be a no-op.

#### Scenario: First Step call loads SPIR-V from disk

- **WHEN** `XPBDGpuSolver::Step` is called for the first time on a populated `PhysicsScene`
- **THEN** the solver reads all XPBD shader SPIR-V files from `<ENGINE_PHYSICS_SPIRV_DIR>/solver/XPBDSolver/`
- **AND** instantiates `ComputeStage` instances from those words

#### Scenario: No GLSL compilation occurs at runtime for XPBD shaders

- **WHEN** the engine runs an XPBD physics example end-to-end
- **THEN** `ShaderCompiler::CompileGLSLtoSPV` is not invoked from `XPBDGpuSolver` code paths

#### Scenario: Missing SPIR-V file produces a diagnostic error

- **WHEN** any XPBD solver SPIR-V file does not exist at runtime
- **AND** `XPBDGpuSolver::Step` is called
- **THEN** a `std::runtime_error` is thrown
- **AND** its `what()` includes the absolute path of the missing file

#### Scenario: Joint shader SPIR-V files are loaded alongside contact shaders

- **WHEN** `EnsureInitialized()` runs
- **THEN** all four joint shader SPIR-V files are loaded from the same directory as contact shaders
- **AND** `ComputeStage` instances are created for each
